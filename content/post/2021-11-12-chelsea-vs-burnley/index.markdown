# Title

Hey boys, just speaking to you through a new medium. That image up there is a featured image that has to be at the top like that. So i think we can either not include that at all or put in a jpeg of a player from the game (probs the motm or something). And then we can put all our analytics and content below (where im writing this stuff rn)

ok now pay me big bucks
